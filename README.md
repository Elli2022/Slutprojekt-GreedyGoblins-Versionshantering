## **Title of the project:** 
*The GreedyGoblins End Project.*

## **Project Description:** 
*This is a school project from the course version control where we are collaborating to learn database Firebase and how to fork and pull request a project. We are getting back end data from Firebase - https://firebase.google.com/ . We are currently 4 members working on this, trying to fork and pull request and merge code without breaking the repository. This project has teached us how to divide and conquer assignments in the project in an effective way. The project itself is rather basic. We have a button that you click to render the text in the DOM that we have texted in the input. We then added an eventListener to the word appearing in the DOM so that you can remove te word you clicked. The site also consists of contributions from outer groups in the class that have forked from,  and pull requested to our project. We also have a page where you can navigate to pages like  "About Us".*
